# Final-Devops-Project
DevOps Project
Overview
This repository contains the code and configurations for a DevOps project focused on automating the software development lifecycle (SDLC) with modern practices such as Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, and monitoring. It aims to streamline the process of building, testing, deploying, and monitoring applications in a scalable and efficient manner.

Features
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated processes for code building, testing, and deployment.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use of [Terraform/CloudFormation] to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning.
Containerization: Docker to create portable application containers.
Security: Integration of automated security checks like vulnerability scanning and code quality analysis.
Technologies Used
CI/CD Tools: Jenkins
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s)
Cloud Providers: AWS
